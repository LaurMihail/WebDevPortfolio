    <h1>The Best Movies</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Star Wars series</h3>
    <p>One of the most successful film series of all time. The movies relies on the strength of pure narrative, in the most basic storytelling form known to man, the Journey.</p>
    <h3>The Godfather</h3>
    <p>The story views the Mafia from the inside. That is its secret, its charm, its spell; in a way, it has shaped the public perception of the Mafia ever since.</p>
    <h3>Indiana Jones series</h3>
    <p>The hat, the whip, the theme song. Harrison Ford stars as the iconic adventurer Indiana Jones, a swashbuckling archaeology professor who spends his free time tracking down lost artifacts in mythic locations.</p>
